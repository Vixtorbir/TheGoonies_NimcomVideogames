# Gameplay
When you use your special attack, remove all that is in the screen (meaning shots, bosses may not disappear).

When you turn, the bullets go faster.

Is faster to shoot spamming than to maintain the button.

If you are in the right of the screen enemies may appear in the left.

With the tri-gun you can only shot in one direction(top), while with laser gun you can shoot in 8 directions.

The laser gun has more damage than the tri gun.

When you stop moving, after a while, a message will appear telling

If you stop walking enemies will stop appearing.
## Controls
There's an eight way joystick which you use to move the character and the direction he shoots, there are two buttons, one for shooting and one for using the special attack.

On the emulator you move yourself with a(left), w(top), s(bottom), d(right), you shoot with j and use your special attack with k.
