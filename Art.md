#Art Style
We weren’t able to find any concept art of the game itself. However, we can clearly see that the game mood is based on the sci-fi movies of the 80’s and 90’s, being the main character a strong cyborg, and the plot about a hero destroying alien bases.

In general, the levels follow a similar art style, as they have various “metallic looking” parts and cyborg enemies. However, depending on which level we are at, the main colors will be different, as each level has to have a different mood.

The art style goes connected with the plot. For example, in the first level, we start in the middle of a jungle, and progressively we start to see more metallic and cyborg elements, doors, enemies, etc. so as we get to darker places as if we were infiltrating in the enemy base.


This goes as well for the colors of the maps tile sets, so that the player feels that as he advances he gets into a less friendly and more aggressive place. For example, in level 1 the colors are friendlier, as the floor is mainly grass, and there are just a few metal parts that are shiny and bright.

As we progress in level 2, we can see how the terrain gets drier and appears the alien logo after breaking through the first door of their base. We can also appreciate how there are more metallic and sci-fi parts in the level that give a more aggressive look to the level.

After defeating the second boss we get to an almost complete cyborg part, except form some lava and burned ground. The ground, and the whole tile set in this level is even darker so that the player feel that they are in a dangerous zone.

The tile set of the 4th level is completely metallic and “robot looking like”, and the colors are very dark with predominance of the grey and purple colors for the most part of the level.

Finally, for the 5th level, we can differentiate 3 different moods, as it starts with blue colors so it looks like a cold and aggressive place, then it turns to yellow which is contrasted with the black color of the holes. This effect makes a contrast between these two colors, so it looks like a dangerous zone. Finally, on the third part of the level, the main color turns red and black. The holes are black, and the rocks and platform red, so the mood feels more alarming.

#Sprites
In order to get the sprites we used the program SpriteTracer and we also took them from the OutZone Apk. We took some of them from websites aswell.
