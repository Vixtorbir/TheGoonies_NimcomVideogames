A number of power-ups can be picked up. Various helmets and jackets prevent Sloth from taking damage from the elements; spellbooks can increase his movement speed; treasure bags will give bonus score or power-ups to the player's vitality or experience bars.

Enemies include booby traps (falling boulders), environmental hazards (waterfalls, dripping water, falling rocks), and traditional enemies (skeletal heads, bats, and the Fratelli Gang).
